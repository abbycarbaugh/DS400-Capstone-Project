# DS400-Capstone-Project

This project uses dataset from a Kaggle challenge, "Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Recognition Challenge." The dataset contains 48x48 greyscale images of faces with different expressions. For this multiclass classification problem there are seven categories - angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise and neutral - that the expression can be classified as. 

The goal for this project is to create a machine learning model using neural networks that can accurately predict the facial expression shown. Along with using the dataset's photos, personal photos of people with different facial expressions will be used in order to test this model's accuracy.

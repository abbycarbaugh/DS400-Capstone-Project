For individuals with autism and others in the community, however, may have a more difficult time recognizing and comprehending these expressions. To help individuals overcome this challenge, the project aims to develop a deep neural network model that can accurately recognize facial expressions. In order to achieve this, a dataset containing photos of people with different expressions was used to train and test the model. This dataset includes images with a variety of expressions, including happy, sad, angry,  surprised, neutral, fear and disgust. Once the model was trained and optimized, it was integrated into an application that can analyze personal photos and predict the facial expression in the image. Once further optimized, this will provide a valuable tool for those with autism and those in the community to better understand the emotions of those around them. This application could also be valuable in the psychology and education fields, where accurate recognition of facial expressions is crucial for understanding human behavior and interactions. Overall, this project has the potential to improve the lives of many individuals and contribute to the advancement of technology in various fields.\")\n",

The goal for this project is to create a machine learning model using neural networks that can accurately predict the facial expression shown. Along with using the dataset's photos, personal photos of people with different facial expressions will be used in order to test this model's accuracy.\")\n",
